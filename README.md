## Overview

An open-source PCB design for the Duck Viper v1 keyboard with hardware upgrades. This project focuses on transparency and community collaboration while building upon existing open-source resources.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not an electrical engineer - this project represents my attempt at "putting the parts together" using available community resources, guides, and libraries. Community feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated!

(Planned *) Upgrades: 
- USB-C Connector
- ESD
- Separate Caps Lock LED
- - RGB Underglow *
- - Additional switches for Split HHKB Bottom Row *
- - MXLockLed *

## Design Philosophy

- **Open Source First**: All design files, schematics, and documentation will be freely available
- **Community Driven**: Built using existing open-source libraries and community knowledge
- **Transparency**: Design decisions and trade-offs documented for others to learn from

## Current Status

### Design Questions (Help Needed!)

**1. QFN vs QFP Package Decision**
- **QFN Pros**: Required for split HHKB layout with IC positioned between Caps Lock and A (see Voyager60 reference)
- **QFN Cons**: Hand soldering difficulty increases prototype cost (~$20 per PCB for 5-unit orders with just an assembled QFN IC vs ~$10 for 5 PCBs ex. assembly)
- **QFP**: Easier to hand solder but may not fit desired layout constraints due to additional stabilizer requirements for split HHKB

QFN IC placement mock-up:

*If going QFN route, schematic verification help would be greatly appreciated!*

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the incredible work of the open-source keyboard community. Specific libraries, guides, and resources used will be documented as the project progresses.

## Contributing

As a learning project, I welcome:
- Schematic reviews and feedback
- Design suggestions and improvements  
- Documentation contributions
- Testing and validation help

## Supported Layouts

kbplacer can use via for switch placement & requires via for collapsing a KLE layout

VIA spec https://www.caniusevia.com/docs/layouts#overview uses KLE raw, but not kle.com's raw json
VIA spec based on [wt60_d](https://github.com/the-via/keyboards/blob/9da730d66a00c3ca1b9b9ac7e7078fc221432501/v3/wilba_tech/wt60_d/wt60_d.json#L9)


```
python -m kbplacer.kle_serial -in keyboard-layout-via.json -inform KLE_VIA -out keyboard-layout-collapsed.json -outform KLE_RAW -collapse
```

```

**linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .

# test kicad
python -c "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.Version())"
```

**Libraries Used:**
- [AcheronProject/AlexandriaLibrary](https://github.com/AcheronProject/AlexandriaLibrary)
- Community keyboard libraries (specific sources TBD)

### Firmware Development

*Detailed firmware setup instructions will be added as development progresses.*

### Manufacturing Files

Generation of Gerber files, pick-and-place files, and BOM will be documented once design is finalized.

## Thanks yo

This project is inspired by [Automated Keyboard PCB design with ergogen and kbplacer](https://github.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer/tree/master/examples/absolem-ergogen). Still, it's far from being fully automated.
